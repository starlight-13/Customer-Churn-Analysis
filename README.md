# Customer-Churn-Analysis
The project aims to analyze churn rates for a telecom company. Performed extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover factors influencing high churn, such as high monthly charges, low tenure, contract type, and no online security or tech support. Addressed class imbalance using SMOTE and evaluated predictive models including decision tree and random forest classifiers.
Achieved 94% recall with the random forest model, leveraging feature engineering and one-hot encoding for categorical variables.
Saved the trained model using Pickle for future deployment in real-world applications
